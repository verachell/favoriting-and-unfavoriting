# favoriting-and-unfavoriting
A very short demo of html and javascript to favorite and unfavorite items

This code snippet is a single html file which also contains javascript. Simply open it in your browser and favorite / unfavorite items by using the checkbox(es). The results are stored in a cookie called faves. 

I'm putting this here largely so I have a record of it elsewhere other than my computer. It's not a fully-fledged piece of software, it's really more of a gist than anything else, but I like having it here to access it easily later.
